# Distracted-Driver-Detection-Model

A major contributing factor to traffic accidents is driver distraction. This project seeks to identify risky driving actions and provide real time reply to the driver through a short audible alarm, etc., using a camera to monitor the driver to reduce traffic accidents and improve traffic safety. The training data consists of 10 categories, which include 9 classes for distracted driving and 1 for safe driving. The model was effectively built to provide a training accuracy and training loss that were correctly calculated at around 95.65% and 13.45%, respectively. In addition, it provides verification accuracy and loss which are equal to approximately 97.25% and 9.54% respectively.
